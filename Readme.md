# Vue to React
## What is it?
This is just my personal way to learning React. It's my personal way to map or convert Vue code to React code, so this repository just contain code snapshot and note. I will devide each topics with each files to make learn easier, from simple to complex.

# Why to make this?
 Before I thought React was pretty hard because I always used vue. I almost never learn other js framework except Vue and Alpine. I hope this repository will help others to use React if you already comfortable using Vue.
